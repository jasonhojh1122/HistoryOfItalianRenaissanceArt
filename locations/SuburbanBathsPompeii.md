The Suburban Baths (Terme Suburbane) are a Roman bathing complex located just outside the Porta Marina gate of ancient Pompeii. Built in the early Imperial period, possibly under Emperor Tiberius (14-37 AD), the baths were constructed after the city walls had lost their defensive function.

The two-story structure features thermal rooms on the ground floor and three rental apartments with coastal views on the upper floor. The complex includes an innovative nymphaeum with a water cascade that allowed bathers to bypass the traditional tepidarium-caldarium bathing sequence.

The baths are most famous for the explicit erotic frescoes discovered in the apodyterium (changing room) in 1986, the only known example of such artwork in a public Roman bath house.
