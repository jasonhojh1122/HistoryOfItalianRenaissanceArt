Pompeii was a city in what is now the municipality of Pompei, near Naples, in the Campania region of Italy. Along with Herculaneum, Stabiae, and many surrounding villas, the city was buried under 4 to 6 m of volcanic ash and pumice in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD.

The site is famous for its well-preserved frescoes, mosaics, and Roman architecture, providing invaluable insight into daily life in the ancient Roman world.
