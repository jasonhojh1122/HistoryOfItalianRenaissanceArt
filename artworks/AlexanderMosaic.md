## Description

The Alexander Mosaic, also known as the Battle of Issus Mosaic, is a Roman floor mosaic originally from the House of the Faun in Pompeii, Italy. It depicts the Battle of Issus (333 BCE) between Alexander the Great and King Darius III of Persia.

The mosaic is composed of approximately 1.5 million tesserae (small colored tiles) and measures approximately 5.82 x 3.13 meters. It is believed to be a copy of a Greek painting, possibly by Philoxenus of Eretria or Apelles.

The dramatic composition shows the moment when Alexander, on horseback at the left, charges toward Darius, who is shown in his war chariot with an expression of alarm. The Persian king's charioteer is already turning the horses to flee.

A replica is displayed at the House of the Faun in Pompeii, while the original is housed in the Naples National Archaeological Museum.
