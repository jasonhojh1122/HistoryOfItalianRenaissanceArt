## Biblical Context

[Last Supper](../biblestories/LastSupper.md) - Jesus's final meal with his twelve disciples before his crucifixion, during which he instituted the Eucharist and announced that one of them would betray him.

## Gospel References

Leonardo synthesized multiple Gospel accounts:
- **Gospel of St. John (13:26)**: Christ identified the betrayer by handing him a piece of bread dipped in wine
- **Gospels of Matthew and Mark**: Christ indicated, "He who dippeth with me in the dish"
- **Luke**: "He whose hand is with me on the table"
- **Matthew, Mark and Luke**: "Verily I say unto you, that one of you shall betray me. And they were exceeding sorrowful, and began every one to say unto him, Lord, is it I"

## Description

Leonardo's masterpiece depicting the moment Jesus announces that one of his disciples will betray him.

### Composition
- Placed Judas among the loyal disciples (unlike earlier depictions)
- Judas is the only apostle who need not protest
- Judas is the only one who reaches for food
- Judas is the only one who recoils from Christ
- Judas is the only one whose face is not in the light
- Christ turns from Judas

### Condition
Poor condition is due to Leonardo's experimental painting technique:
- In 1566 it was already in a bad state
- Repainted twice in the eighteenth century
- Suffered from Napoleonic soldiers and monks
- Repainted again in the nineteenth century
- The building was bombed by Allied forces in WWII

### Study Drawing
Study of Composition of Last Supper at [Accademia](../locations/Accademia.md), Venice shows Judas was originally placed at our side of the table, which is not the case in the final artwork.
