## Description

One of the most spectacular garden frescoes from the ancient world, originally covering all walls and the vaulted ceiling of a garden room (oecus). The painting depicts a lush paradise garden with remarkable botanical and ornithological detail.

The fresco features:
- **Plants**: Oleander, viburnum, arbutus, bay, palm trees, irises, roses, daisies, and poppies
- **Birds**: Doves, house sparrows, swallows, golden orioles, and jays
- **Decorative elements**: A birdbath, herms supporting plaques showing sleeping women, and theater masks
- **Structure**: A black background socle with vegetal tufts, a cane fence with luxurious garden above, and an upper register with ornamental elements and architectural motifs

The house was named for a gold bracelet (weighing 610 grams) found on the skeleton of a woman. Tragically, in 1974 casts revealed four people—a man, woman, and two small children—who died trapped beneath a staircase during the eruption's second day.

The frescoes were damaged in the eruption but fragments were discovered in 1980 in the volcanic debris. Restoration and reassembly continues.
