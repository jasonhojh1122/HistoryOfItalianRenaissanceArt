## Biblical Context

[Baptism of Christ](../biblestories/BaptismOfChrist.md) - The moment when John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the Jordan River. As described in Matthew 3:13-17, the heavens opened and the Spirit of God descended like a dove, while a voice from heaven declared "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased."

## Description

Painted primarily by Verrocchio, but the leftmost angel and parts of the landscape are attributed to his young apprentice Leonardo da Vinci.
