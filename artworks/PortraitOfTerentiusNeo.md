## Description

One of the finest Roman portrait frescoes to survive from antiquity, depicting a middle-class couple holding objects symbolizing literacy and education. The work was sometimes erroneously called the "Portrait of Paquius Proculus" due to confusion with another house.

The man, Terentius Neo, was a bakery owner. He wears a toga (mark of Roman citizenship) and holds a rotulus (scroll), suggesting involvement in public or cultural affairs. His wife holds a stylus and wax tablet, emphasizing her education and literacy.

The portrait is remarkable for several reasons:
- Shows the couple as equals in status
- Displays realistic imperfections and peculiarities in their faces
- Represents a confident, fashionable mercantile class
- Originally displayed beneath a smaller painting of Cupid and Psyche
