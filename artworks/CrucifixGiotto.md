## Biblical Context

[Crucifixion](../biblestories/Crucifixion.md) - The death of Jesus Christ on the cross at Golgotha, as described in all four Gospels (Matthew 27:32-56, Mark 15:21-41, Luke 23:26-49, John 19:17-37). This central event in Christian theology represents Christ's sacrifice for the redemption of humanity's sins.

## Description

The earliest known artwork by Giotto. Revolutionary in its naturalistic depiction of Christ's suffering body, departing from the rigid Byzantine tradition.
