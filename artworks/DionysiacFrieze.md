## Description

The Dionysiac Frieze is a series of exquisite frescoes in Room 5 of the Villa of the Mysteries, a well-preserved suburban ancient Roman villa on the outskirts of Pompeii. These paintings are among the best known of the relatively rare survivals of Ancient Roman painting from the 1st century BC.

The frescoes depict a continuous narrative that wraps around the walls of the room. They are usually interpreted as showing the initiation of a bride into a Greco-Roman mystery cult, likely the cult of Dionysus (Bacchus). The scenes include:

- A young woman reading a ritual text
- Preparation of a ritual meal
- A satyr playing a lyre
- A startled woman fleeing
- The unveiling of a sacred object
- A winged figure preparing to strike with a whip
- A woman being comforted after flagellation
- A dancing Maenad
- The dressing of the bride

The frieze is painted on a characteristic Pompeian red background and demonstrates the sophisticated Second Style of Roman wall painting.
