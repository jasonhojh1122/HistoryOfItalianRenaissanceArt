## Description

A striking portrait of a finely dressed young woman with a writing tablet and stylus, symbols used in Roman painting to indicate literacy and education. The woman has short, curly brown hair, a gold hairnet, gold earrings, and clothes dyed purple and green.

She gazes directly at the viewer, holding a set of wax tablets bound with ribbons in her left hand while pressing a writing stylus to her lips in thoughtful contemplation.

The portrait was speculatively identified as the Greek poet Sappho in the 19th century, though no evidence supports this. Most modern scholars believe it depicts an educated, upper-class Pompeian woman. The fresco was discovered on 17 May 1760 alongside a panel depicting the myth of Andromeda and Perseus.

The fresco influenced the Chinese poet Shao Xunmei, who was inspired to take up poetry after seeing it in Naples in the early 1920s.
