## Description

The Cave Canem ("Beware of the Dog") mosaic is one of the most famous images from ancient Pompeii. Located at the entrance of the House of the Tragic Poet, this black and white floor mosaic depicts a chained dog with the Latin inscription "CAVE CANEM" below it.

The mosaic served as both a practical warning to visitors and a decorative entrance feature. Such "beware of dog" mosaics were common in Roman homes and were believed to ward off evil spirits as well as protect homes from intruders.

The House of the Tragic Poet itself is a Roman house dating to the 2nd century BCE, famous for its elaborate mosaic floors and frescoes depicting scenes from Greek mythology. The house takes its name from a mosaic found in the tablinum depicting a theatrical rehearsal or choragus.
