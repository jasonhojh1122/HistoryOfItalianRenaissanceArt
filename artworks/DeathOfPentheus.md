## Mythological Context

Pentheus was the legendary King of Thebes who refused to acknowledge Dionysus (Bacchus) as a god and banned his worship. Dionysus escaped imprisonment and enchanted Pentheus to spy on the Dionysian rites on Mount Cithaeron. There, his own mother Agave and aunts, in a divine frenzy, mistook him for a lion and tore him apart.

## Description

A powerful Fourth Style fresco depicting the violent climax of the Pentheus myth. The scene shows Pentheus being discovered and attacked by the maenads (female followers of Dionysus).

Key elements:
- **Center**: A maenad holds a stone above her head, about to hurl it at Pentheus
- **Figures**: Pentheus's mother Agave and aunts Ino and Autonoë participate in the killing
- **Upper corners**: Two Erinyes (Furies) appear, with one raising a whip
- **Composition**: Shows the moment of recognition and initial attack

The fresco serves as a moral warning about the consequences of defying the gods. It is one of twelve surviving mythological panels in the House of the Vettii, believed to be copied from Greek models.

The House of the Vettii was owned by two freedmen brothers and features some of the finest Fourth Style frescoes in Pompeii.
