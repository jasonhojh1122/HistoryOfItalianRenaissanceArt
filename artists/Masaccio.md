Born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, Masaccio was the first great Italian painter of the Quattrocento period. According to Vasari, he was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at imitating nature, recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality.
