# Delivery of the Keys

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commissioning_of_the_Twelve_Apostles)

## Summary

The Delivery of the Keys depicts the moment when Christ gives the keys of the kingdom of heaven to Saint Peter, establishing Peter's authority as the first Pope and foundation of the Catholic Church. This scene represents Christ's conferral of authority upon Peter to "bind and loose"—to make binding decisions for the Church. The keys symbolize the power to admit souls to heaven and have become the central symbol of papal authority.
