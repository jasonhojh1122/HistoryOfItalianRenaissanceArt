## Summary

The Last Judgement depicts the final and eternal judgment by God of all humanity. According to Christian eschatology, at the end of time, Christ will return in glory to judge the living and the dead. The righteous will be welcomed into eternal life in heaven, while the wicked will be condemned to eternal punishment in hell. The scene typically shows Christ enthroned as judge, surrounded by angels, with the saved ascending to heaven on one side and the damned descending to hell on the other.
