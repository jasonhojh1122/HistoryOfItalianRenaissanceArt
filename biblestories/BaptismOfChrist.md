# Baptism of Christ

## Summary

The Baptism of Christ depicts the moment when John the Baptist baptizes Jesus in the Jordan River. As Jesus came up from the water, the heavens opened and the Spirit of God descended like a dove and alighted on him. A voice from heaven declared "This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased." This event marks the beginning of Jesus's public ministry and reveals the Trinity—the Father's voice, the Son in the water, and the Holy Spirit as a dove.
