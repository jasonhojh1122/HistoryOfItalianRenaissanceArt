# Madonna and Child

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(art))

## Summary

The Madonna and Child depicts the Virgin Mary with the infant Jesus. This iconic image represents the Incarnation—God becoming human through Christ's birth to Mary. While not depicting a specific biblical narrative, this devotional image draws from the Gospel accounts of Christ's birth and infancy. The scene emphasizes Mary's role as Theotokos (Mother of God) and the tender relationship between mother and divine child. It became one of the most prevalent subjects in Christian art, particularly in Italian Renaissance painting.
