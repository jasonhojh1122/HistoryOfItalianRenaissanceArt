[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamentation_of_Christ)

## Summary

The Lamentation (also known as Pietà when focused on Mary alone with Christ's body) depicts the mourning over Christ's body after the Crucifixion and Deposition, but before his burial. While not directly described in scripture, this scene is derived from the burial accounts in the Gospels. The Virgin Mary typically holds or sits near the body of her dead son, accompanied by other mourners such as Mary Magdalene, John the Evangelist, Joseph of Arimathea, and Nicodemus. The scene emphasizes the human sorrow and grief following Christ's death.
