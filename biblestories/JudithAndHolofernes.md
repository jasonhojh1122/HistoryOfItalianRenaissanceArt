## Summary

The story of Judith and Holofernes comes from the deuterocanonical Book of Judith. When the Assyrian general Holofernes besieged the Jewish city of Bethulia, the beautiful widow Judith devised a plan to save her people. She entered the Assyrian camp, gaining Holofernes' trust with her beauty and wisdom. When Holofernes became drunk at a banquet, Judith seized his own sword and beheaded him. She returned to Bethulia with his head, and the leaderless Assyrian army fled in confusion. The story represents the triumph of virtue over tyranny and of the weak over the powerful through faith in God.
