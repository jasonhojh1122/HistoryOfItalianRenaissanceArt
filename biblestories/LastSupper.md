## Summary

The Last Supper depicts Jesus's final meal with his twelve disciples before his crucifixion, during which he instituted the Eucharist. Jesus told his disciples that one of them would betray him, and identified Judas as the betrayer. He then took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them saying "This is my body." He also took a cup of wine saying "This is my blood of the covenant, which is poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins." This event is commemorated in the Christian sacrament of Communion.
