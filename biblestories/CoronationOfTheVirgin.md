[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_Virgin)

## Summary

The Coronation of the Virgin depicts the Virgin Mary being crowned Queen of Heaven by Christ (or sometimes by the Trinity). While not directly described in scripture, this scene represents a tradition in Catholic theology following Mary's Assumption into heaven. The scene typically shows Mary seated or kneeling before Christ, who places a crown upon her head, often surrounded by angels and saints in heavenly glory. The doctrine emphasizes Mary's special status as the Mother of God and her eternal reign in heaven.
