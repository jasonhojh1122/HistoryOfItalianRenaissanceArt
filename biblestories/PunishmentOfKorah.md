# Punishment of Korah

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Korah_(rebel))

## Summary

The punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram recounts a rebellion against the leadership of Moses and Aaron during the Israelites' wilderness wanderings. Korah, a Levite, along with Dathan, Abiram, and 250 community leaders, challenged Moses' authority, claiming that all the congregation was holy and questioning why Moses exalted himself. God's punishment was swift and dramatic: the earth opened and swallowed Korah, Dathan, Abiram, and their households, while fire from the Lord consumed the 250 men who offered incense. The story served as a warning against challenging divinely appointed authority.
