## Summary

The Adoration of the Shepherds depicts the visit of the shepherds to the newborn Jesus in Bethlehem. An angel appeared to shepherds keeping watch over their flocks by night and announced the birth of the Savior, saying "Fear not: for, behold, I bring you good tidings of great joy." The heavenly host praised God saying "Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men." The shepherds then went to Bethlehem and found Mary, Joseph, and the baby lying in a manger.
