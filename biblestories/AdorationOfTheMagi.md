## Summary

The Adoration of the Magi describes the visit of the three wise men (Magi) from the East who followed a star to Bethlehem to pay homage to the infant Jesus. The Magi—traditionally named Caspar, Melchior, and Balthasar—brought gifts of gold, frankincense, and myrrh, symbolizing Christ's kingship, divinity, and future death. After being warned in a dream not to return to Herod, they departed for their own country by another route.
