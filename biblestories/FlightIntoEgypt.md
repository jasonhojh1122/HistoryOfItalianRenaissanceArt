## Summary

The Flight into Egypt describes the journey of the Holy Family—Mary, Joseph, and the infant Jesus—to Egypt to escape King Herod's Massacre of the Innocents. After the Magi departed without reporting back to Herod, an angel appeared to Joseph in a dream warning him to flee with his family because Herod intended to kill the child. The family remained in Egypt until Herod's death, fulfilling the prophecy "Out of Egypt I called my son."
