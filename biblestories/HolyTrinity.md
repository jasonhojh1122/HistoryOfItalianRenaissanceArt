# Holy Trinity

[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trinity)

## Summary

The Holy Trinity represents the Christian doctrine of the three persons of God: the Father, the Son (Jesus Christ), and the Holy Spirit, who are coequal, coeternal, and consubstantial, yet are one God. This fundamental Christian belief holds that God exists as one being in three distinct persons. In art, the Trinity is often depicted with God the Father supporting Christ crucified, with the Holy Spirit represented as a dove between them, visualizing the unity and distinction of the three persons.
