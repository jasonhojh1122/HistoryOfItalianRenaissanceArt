## Summary

The Deposition (or Descent from the Cross) depicts the removal of Christ's body from the cross after the Crucifixion. According to the Gospels, Joseph of Arimathea, a secret disciple of Jesus, asked Pilate for permission to take Christ's body. He and Nicodemus carefully removed the body from the cross, wrapped it in linen cloths with spices, and prepared it for burial. The scene often shows the Virgin Mary, Mary Magdalene, and other followers present at this solemn moment.
